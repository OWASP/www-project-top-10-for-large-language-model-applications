Remember, an issue is not the place to ask questions. You can use our [Slack channel](https://github.com/OWASP/www-project-top-10-for-large-language-model-applications/wiki) for that, or you may want to start a discussion on the [Discussion Board](https://github.com/OWASP/www-project-top-10-for-large-language-model-applications/discussions).
