Remember, an issue is not the place to ask questions. You can use our [Slack channel](https://github.com/OWASP/www-project-top-10-for-large-language-model-applications/wiki) for that, or you may want to consult the following Slack channels:

- [#project-top10-for-llm](https://owasp.slack.com/archives/C05956H7R8R)
- [#team-llm-web](https://owasp.slack.com/archives/C06RXVCQB1C)
- [#team-llm_diagrams_and_visuals](https://owasp.slack.com/archives/C05L7TW8VCY)
- Each vulnerabilities has its own dedicated Slack channel for discussions in the format of `#team-llm0X`, I.E ([#team-llm03_data_and_model_poisoning](https://owasp.slack.com/archives/C05F7JWFYBU))
