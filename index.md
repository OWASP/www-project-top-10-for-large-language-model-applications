## About This Repository

This is the repository for the **OWASP Top 10 for Large Language Model Applications**. However, this project has now grown into the comprehensive **OWASP GenAI Security Project** - a global initiative that encompasses multiple security initiatives beyond just the Top 10 list.

## OWASP GenAI Security Project

The OWASP GenAI Security Project is a global, open-source initiative dedicated to identifying, mitigating, and documenting security and safety risks associated with generative AI technologies, including large language models (LLMs), agentic AI systems, and AI-driven applications. Our mission is to empower organizations, security professionals, AI practitioners, and policymakers with comprehensive, actionable guidance and tools to ensure the secure development, deployment, and governance of generative AI systems.

## Project Background and Growth

The project has evolved significantly since its inception. From a small group of security professionals addressing an urgent security gap in 2023, it has grown into a global community with over 600 contributing experts from more than 18 countries and nearly 8,000 active community members.
