## About This Repository

This is the repository for the **OWASP Top 10 for Large Language Model Applications Inititive**. This project is part of the **OWASP GenAI Security Project** - a compresensive global initiative with working groups encompassing the complete LLM, Generative AI and Agentic AI application security lifecycle. 

## OWASP GenAI Security Project

The OWASP GenAI Security Project is a global, open-source initiative dedicated to identifying, mitigating, and documenting security and safety risks associated with generative AI technologies, including large language models (LLMs), agentic AI systems, and AI-driven applications. Our mission is to empower organizations, security professionals, AI practitioners, and policymakers with comprehensive, actionable guidance and tools to ensure the secure development, deployment, and governance of generative AI systems.
