### Recommended Automated Validation Tools

For a robust validation strategy, complement the above Python script with automated tools capable of continuous scanning and alerting based on the specific vulnerabilities and controls referenced:

- **SonarQube**: Useful for continuous inspection of code quality to detect bugs, vulnerabilities, and code smells in your Python scripts.
- **OWASP ZAP (Zed Attack Proxy)**: For identifying vulnerabilities in your web applications by simulating attacks.
- **Bandit**: A tool designed to find common security issues in Python code.
- **Black Duck**: Helps in identifying and mitigating open-source software vulnerabilities, including those that could affect supply chains (LLM05).

Integrating these tools into your development and deployment pipelines can significantly enhance your security posture by automating the detection of potential vulnerabilities and compliance issues.
