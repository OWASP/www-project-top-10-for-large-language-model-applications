### Note on Automated Validation Tools
For validating structured data derived from the markdown content or other aspects of your project where structured data validation is applicable, tools like Great Expectations, Pydantic, or Cerberus can be highly effective. They require structured data inputs, so additional preprocessing would be necessary to convert markdown sections into a format these tools can work with, such as JSON or a Python dictionary.

Great Expectations is particularly well-suited for complex validation scenarios and can integrate with data pipelines for continuous data quality checks. Pydantic excels in data parsing and validation through Python type annotations, offering a robust solution for ensuring data types and formats meet expected criteria. Cerberus provides a flexible and lightweight option for validating Python data structures against a customizable schema, useful for a variety of validation tasks.
