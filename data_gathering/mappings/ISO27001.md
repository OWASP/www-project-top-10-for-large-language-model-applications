# OWASP Top 10 for LLMs Mapped to ISO/IEC 27001 Controls

This document outlines how the [OWASP Top 10 for Large Language Model Applications](https://owasp.org/www-project-top-10-for-large-language-model-applications/#) can be addressed through the implementation of [ISO/IEC 27001](https://www.iso.org/isoiec-27001-information-security.html) controls. ISO 27001 provides a comprehensive set of information security standards that can be leveraged to mitigate risks associated with these vulnerabilities.

## ISO/IEC 27001 Controls and Principles

For each LLM vulnerability, relevant ISO 27001 controls and principles are suggested to enhance security and manage risks:

## LLM01: Prompt Injection

- **A.14 System acquisition, development and maintenance**: Ensure security is integrated into the development lifecycle, including input validation mechanisms to prevent prompt injection. [(A.14 Reference)](https://www.iso.org/standard/54534.html)
- **A.18 Compliance**: Ensure compliance with legal and technical requirements to protect against security breaches stemming from prompt injection. [(A.18 Reference)](https://www.iso.org/standard/54535.html)

## LLM02: Insecure Output Handling

- **A.14 System acquisition, development and maintenance**: Implement secure coding practices and output encoding to prevent insecure output handling. [(A.14 Reference)](https://www.iso.org/standard/54534.html)
- **A.10 Cryptography**: Utilize encryption and key management practices to secure data in transit and at rest, mitigating risks of data exposure through insecure outputs. [(A.10 Reference)](https://www.iso.org/standard/54533.html)

## LLM03: Training Data Poisoning

- **A.12 Operations security**: Apply secure procedures for managing data processing and storage to prevent training data poisoning. [(A.12 Reference)](https://www.iso.org/standard/54532.html)
- **A.16 Information security incident management**: Establish incident management processes to respond to incidents of data poisoning effectively. [(A.16 Reference)](https://www.iso.org/standard/54536.html)

## LLM04: Model Denial of Service

- **A.17 Information security aspects of business continuity management**: Develop and implement business continuity plans that address the risk of model denial of service. [(A.17 Reference)](https://www.iso.org/standard/54537.html)
- **A.13 Communications security**: Secure network services against DoS attacks through traffic filtering, monitoring, and management. [(A.13 Reference)](https://www.iso.org/standard/54531.html)

## LLM05: Supply-Chain Vulnerabilities

- **A.15 Supplier relationships**: Manage risks related to suppliers and service providers to address supply-chain vulnerabilities. [(A.15 Reference)](https://www.iso.org/standard/54538.html)
- **A.14 System acquisition, development and maintenance**: Ensure that information security is a key criterion in the development and acquisition of software products and services. [(A.14 Reference)](https://www.iso.org/standard/54534.html)

## LLM06: Sensitive Information Disclosure

- **A.8 Asset management**: Classify information assets and apply appropriate controls to prevent unauthorized access and disclosure. [(A.8 Reference)](https://www.iso.org/standard/54529.html)
- **A.13 Communications security**: Implement network security controls and encryption to protect sensitive data during transmission. [(A.13 Reference)](https://www.iso.org/standard/54531.html)

## LLM07: Insecure Plugin Design

- **A.14 System acquisition, development and maintenance**: Integrate security considerations into the development and maintenance of plugins. [(A.14 Reference)](https://www.iso.org/standard/54534.html)
- **A.12 Operations security**: Apply strict access controls and monitoring to manage the risks associated with third-party plugins. [(A.12 Reference)](https://www.iso.org/standard/54532.html)

## LLM08: Excessive Agency

- **A.6 Organization of information security**: Define roles and responsibilities clearly to manage the risks of excessive agency in LLMs. [(A.6 Reference)](https://www.iso.org/standard/54527.html)
- **A.14 System acquisition, development and maintenance**: Incorporate functionality that ensures LLMs operate within their intended boundaries. [(A.14 Reference)](https://www.iso.org/standard/54534.html)

## LLM09: Overreliance

- **A.7 Human resource security**: Provide awareness training to staff to mitigate the risks associated with overreliance on LLM technologies. [(A.7 Reference)](https://www.iso.org/standard/54528.html)
- **A.5 Information security policies**: Develop policies that address the appropriate use of LLM technologies and define acceptable levels of reliance. [(A.5 Reference)](https://www.iso.org/standard/54526.html)

## LLM10: Model Theft

- **A.8 Asset management**: Identify and classify LLM models as critical information assets, implementing strong access control and protection measures. [(A.8 Reference)](https://www.iso.org/standard/54529.html)
- **A.13 Communications security**: Secure the transmission of model data to prevent unauthorized interception and theft. [(A.13 Reference)](https://www.iso.org/standard/54531.html)

Note: Implementing ISO 27001 controls requires a comprehensive approach to information security management. Organizations should conduct regular risk assessments to identify and address specific vulnerabilities associated with LLM technologies, applying the relevant ISO 27001 controls to mitigate these risks effectively.
