# OWASP Top 10 for LLMs Mapped to BSIMM Activities

This document outlines how the [OWASP Top 10 for Large Language Model Applications](https://owasp.org/www-project-top-10-for-large-language-model-applications/#) can be addressed through the [Building Security In Maturity Model (BSIMM)](https://www.bsimm.com/) framework. BSIMM provides a set of software security practices organized into twelve domains, which can help mitigate these vulnerabilities through proactive and systematic security efforts.

## General Approach with BSIMM

To mitigate LLM vulnerabilities, organizations can adopt relevant BSIMM activities across its twelve domains. Here's how specific BSIMM practices can be applied:

## LLM01: Prompt Injection

- **Strategy & Metrics (SM)**: Define and measure security goals specific to LLM development.
- **Security Testing (ST)**: Implement automated and manual testing to detect prompt injection vulnerabilities.

## LLM02: Insecure Output Handling

- **Secure Coding (SC)**: Train developers on secure coding practices to prevent insecure output handling.
- **Security Testing (ST)**: Use dynamic analysis tools to identify and mitigate output handling issues.

## LLM03: Training Data Poisoning

- **Policy & Compliance (PC)**: Establish policies for secure handling and validation of training data.
- **Software Environment (SE)**: Secure the software environment against unauthorized access to training data.

## LLM04: Model Denial of Service

- **Architecture Analysis (AA)**: Conduct architecture analysis to identify potential DoS vulnerabilities in LLMs.
- **Performance Testing (PT)**: Simulate high-load scenarios to assess the model's resilience to DoS attacks.

## LLM05: Supply-Chain Vulnerabilities

- **Vendor Security Management (VSM)**: Assess and manage security risks associated with third-party components and services.
- **Security Standards and Requirements (SSR)**: Define security requirements for all suppliers and partners.

## LLM06: Sensitive Information Disclosure

- **Data Protection (DP)**: Implement data classification and encryption to protect sensitive information.
- **Security Testing (ST)**: Regularly test for vulnerabilities that could lead to information disclosure.

## LLM07: Insecure Plugin Design

- **Design Review (DR)**: Perform security design reviews for plugins and extensions.
- **Secure Coding (SC)**: Educate developers on secure plugin design and development practices.

## LLM08: Excessive Agency

- **Architecture Analysis (AA)**: Evaluate the decision-making processes of LLMs for security risks.
- **Design Review (DR)**: Review and assess the security implications of LLM agency and control mechanisms.

## LLM09: Overreliance

- **Education & Guidance (EG)**: Provide training on the appropriate use of LLM technologies and the risks of overreliance.
- **Strategy & Metrics (SM)**: Develop metrics to measure and manage the reliance on LLMs in critical decision-making processes.

## LLM10: Model Theft

- **Software Environment (SE)**: Secure access to model data and runtime environments.
- **Data Protection (DP)**: Use encryption and access controls to protect models from unauthorized access or theft.

Note: While BSIMM provides a framework for building secure software, it's important to tailor these activities to the specific context of LLM development and deployment. Organizations should assess their security practices against BSIMM to identify areas for improvement and implement the most relevant activities to mitigate the risks associated with LLM vulnerabilities.
