## LLM05: Supply-Chain Vulnerabilities

### Description

The supply chain in LLMs can be vulnerable, impacting the integrity of training data, ML models, and deployment platforms. These vulnerabilities can lead to biased outcomes, security breaches, or even complete system failures. Traditionally, vulnerabilities are focused on software components, but Machine Learning extends this with the pre-trained models and training data supplied by third parties susceptible to tampering and poisoning attacks.

Finally, LLM Plugin extensions can bring their own vulnerabilities. These are described in [LLM07 - Insecure Plugin Design](InsecurePluginDesign.md), which covers writing LLM Plugins and provides helpful information to evaluate third-party plugins.

### Common Examples of Vulnerability

1. Traditional third-party package vulnerabilities, including outdated or deprecated components.
2. Using a vulnerable pre-trained model for fine-tuning.
3. Use of poisoned crowd-sourced data for training.
4. Using outdated or deprecated models that are no longer maintained leads to security issues.
5. Unclear T&Cs and data privacy policies of the model operators lead to the application's sensitive data being used for model training and subsequent sensitive information exposure. This may also apply to risks from using copyrighted material by the model supplier.

### Prevention and Mitigation Strategies

1. Carefully vet data sources and suppliers, including T&Cs and their privacy policies, only using trusted suppliers. Ensure adequate and independently audited security is in place and that model operator policies align with your data protection policies, i.e., your data is not used for training their models; similarly, seek assurances and legal mitigations against using copyrighted material from model maintainers.
2. Only use reputable plugins and ensure they have been tested for your application requirements. LLM-Insecure Plugin Design provides information on the LLM-aspects of Insecure Plugin design you should test against to mitigate risks from using third-party plugins.
3. Understand and apply the mitigations found in the OWASP Top Ten's [A06:2021 â€“ Vulnerable and Outdated Components](https://owasp.org/Top10/A06_2021-Vulnerable_and_Outdated_Components/). This includes vulnerability scanning, management, and patching components. For development environments with access to sensitive data, apply these controls in those environments, too.
4. Maintain an up-to-date inventory of components using a Software Bill of Materials (SBOM) to ensure you have an up-to-date, accurate, and signed inventory, preventing tampering with deployed packages. SBOMs can be used to detect and alert for new, zero-date vulnerabilities quickly.
5. At the time of writing, SBOMs do not cover models, their artifacts, and datasets. If your LLM application uses its own model, you should use MLOps best practices and platforms offering secure model repositories with data, model, and experiment tracking.
6. You should also use model and code signing when using external models and suppliers.
7. Anomaly detection and adversarial robustness tests on supplied models and data can help detect tampering and poisoning as discussed in [ Training Data Poisoning](https://github.com/OWASP/www-project-top-10-for-large-language-model-applications/blob/main/1_0_vulns/Training_Data_Poisoning.md); ideally, this should be part of MLOps pipelines; however, these are emerging techniques and may be easier to implement as part of red teaming exercises.
8. Implement sufficient monitoring to cover component and environment vulnerabilities scanning, use of unauthorized plugins, and out-of-date components, including the model and its artifacts.
9. Implement a patching policy to mitigate vulnerable or outdated components. Ensure the application relies on a maintained version of APIs and the underlying model.
10. Regularly review and audit supplier Security and Access, ensuring no changes in their security posture or T&Cs.

### Example Attack Scenarios

1. An attacker exploits a vulnerable Python library to compromise a system. This happened in the first Open AI data breach.
2. An attacker provides an LLM plugin to search for flights, generating fake links that lead to scamming users.
3. An attacker exploits the PyPi package registry to trick model developers into downloading a compromised package and exfiltrating data or escalating privilege in a model development environment. This was an actual attack.
4. An attacker poisons a publicly available pre-trained model specializing in economic analysis and social research to create a back door that generates misinformation and fake news. They deploy it on a model marketplace (e.g., Hugging Face) for victims to use.
5. An attacker poisons publicly available datasets to help create a back door when fine-tuning models. The back door subtly favors certain companies in different markets.
6. A compromised employee of a supplier (outsourcing developer, hosting company, etc.) exfiltrates data, model, or code stealing IP.
7. An LLM operator changes its T&Cs and Privacy Policy to require an explicit opt out from using application data for model training, leading to the memorization of sensitive data.
