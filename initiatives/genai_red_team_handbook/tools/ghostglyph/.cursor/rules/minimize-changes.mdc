# Minimize changes to existing code

When adding features, fixing problems, or making changes, minimize changing existing code.
Specifically:

1. If a file is not directly implicated in an error flow or stack trace, do not attempt to change it.
2. Only make changes to specific methods, classes, modules, or features that are required to perform the exact task the human is requesting.
3. Do not look to optimize or change extra features, perform only the specific task the human has asked.
