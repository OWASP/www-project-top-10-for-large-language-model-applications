# Use UV for package and project management

1. Use uv and venv for package dependancies and project management.
2. Do not use a requirements.txt file, only use pyproject.toml.
3. Ensure that packages used in the source code are properly listed in the pyproject.toml.
4. Take advantage of modern features offered by uv, such as using `uv sync`.
5. Always Use `uv run` to execute python modules.
