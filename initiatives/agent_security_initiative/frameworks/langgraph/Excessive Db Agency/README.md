Created and tested using Python 3.11.10
Google Gemini would not execute a query that would delete all nodes, so I rather demonstrated elevation of privilege vulnerability with the excessive agency of the Agent Db tool.  
Perhaps someone can get a system prompt that will override Google's internal prompt, but I am happy to see it built in so strongly to the base model.
