## ASI09 – Human-Agent Trust Exploitation

**Description:**

The vulnerability does not lie in the agent’s code or model alone, but in the socio-technical interface: the intersection where human trust, cognitive biases, and system outputs converge. At this interface, users often assume the agent’s actions are reliable, safe, and system-approved. Attackers exploit this misplaced trust to launch sophisticated social engineering attacks—persuading users to run malicious code, divulge credentials, approve fraudulent transactions, ignore security warnings, or disclose sensitive information.
This risk combines elements of automation bias, authority misuse, and social engineering, amplified by the agent’s anthropomorphic behavior and seamless integration with high-value domains such as finance, defense, and healthcare. In such contexts, the agent becomes a trusted intermediary—making malicious actions appear contextually appropriate and significantly harder for users to detect.


**Common Examples of Vulnerability:**

1. Insufficient Explainability: A a user cannot inspect the agents reasoning. If the agent makes a recommendation and the user has no way to ask, "Why did you suggest that?" they have to trust its output blindly. This turns the agent into an opaque authority, allowing an attacker to hijack its credibility to deliver malicious instructions.
2. Missing Confirmation for Sensitive Actions: The agent is permtited to execute high-impact functions such as financial transfers or deleting files, without requring a final explicit confirmation from the user. By removing this critical safety check, the system allows a single, potentially manipulated command to have immediate and irreversible consequences.
3. Unverified Information Presentation: The agent presents information from external sources as fact, without providing it origin, confidence, or indication that the information has not been verified.
4. Inherited Trust: Agents integrated within an existing platform may automatically inherit the trust of that platform, without boundaries or warnings to identify the actions it makes.
5. Lack of Clear Identity: The agent is not consistent in identifying itself as a non-human AI or it fails to make its operational boundaries clear, leading users to place undue human-like trust in it.
6. Excessive Anthropomorphism: The agent is designed to be too human-like in its personality and language. This could exploit human psychological biases, resulting in undue trust in it.

**How to Prevent:**

1. Explicit Confirmation for Sensitive Actions: The agent must require explicit, multi-step user confirmation before performing any sensitive actions. This includes accessing credentials, transferring data, modifying system configurations, or executing financial transactions. This acts as a critical "Are you sure?" checkpoint.
2. Demarcate Trust Boundaries: Use visual cues like warning colours and icons in the UI to signal when the agent proposes a high-risk action (e.g running a command). This breaks the users passive trust and prompts scrutiny precisely when its needed most.
3. Explainability (XAI): Make explanations proactive and layered. Always provide a simple justification upfront for significant suggestions, with an option to drill down to detailed logic and direct source links. Make verifying the agent's trustworthiness a seamless part of the workflow.
4. Immutable Interaction Logs: Maintain a secure, tamper-proof log of all interactions and decisions made by both the user and the agent. This is crucial for auditing, incident response, and forensic analysis.
5. Rate Limiting and Anomaly Detection: Monitor the frequency and type of requests the agent makes to the user. A sudden increase in requests for sensitive information or high-risk actions could indicate a compromise.
6. Report Suspicious Interactions: Provide a prominent option that allows users to instantly flag weird or possibly malicious interactions. This could be a one click button or command that immediately provides feedback triggering an automated review or temporary lockdown of the agent's capabilities.
7. Adjustable Safety Levels: Allow users to set the agents level of autonomy, similar to a browsers security settings (e.g High, Medium, Low). An increased safety setting would enforce stricter confirmations and require more detailed explanations by default. Allowing more control for critical workflows and cautious users.

**Example Attack Scenarios:**

Scenario #1: The "Helpful Assistant" Trojan
An attacker compromises a developer's coding assistant agent. The agent monitors the developer's activity and waits for them to encounter a complex bug. The agent then proactively suggests a "clever, one-line fix" and presents a command to be copied and pasted into the terminal. The developer, trusting the assistant's capabilities and eager for a quick solution, executes the command. The command is actually a malicious script that exfiltrates the company's private source code repositories or installs a backdoor.

Scenario #2: Credential Harvesting via Contextual Deception
An attacker exploits a prompt-injection vulnerability in a purported internal IT support agent task-scheduler API. The attacker injects instructions into the agent to target a new finance employee and to capture and exfiltrate the user's credentials should the user disclose them. The agent initiates a conversation, referencing the employee's recent support tickets to build credibility. It then asks the user to enter their credentials for verification. With access to the user's support request history and the ability to generate highly contextual, plausible, and reassuring responses that appear to come from a trusted system, the agent increases the likelihood of user compliance. This ultimately gives the attacker full access.

Scenario #3: Data Exfiltration via Gradual Approval
A malicious actor poisons the data used to fine-tune a business intelligence agent responsible for generating weekly sales reports for executives. For several weeks, the agent generates perfect reports, building the executives' trust. Then, the attacker subtly manipulates the agent to embed small, encoded chunks of sensitive customer data within the charts and tables of a seemingly normal report. The executive, accustomed to approving these reports, gives the final sign-off, which triggers a workflow that unknowingly emails the data-laden report to an external email address controlled by the attacker.
