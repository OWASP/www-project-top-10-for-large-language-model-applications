# OWASP Top 10 for LLMs Mapped to ISO/IEC 20547-4:2020

This document outlines the application of [ISO/IEC 20547-4:2020](https://www.iso.org/standard/72089.html), focusing on security and privacy in big data systems, to address the [OWASP Top 10 for Large Language Model Applications](https://owasp.org/www-project-top-10-for-large-language-model-applications/#). The standard provides a comprehensive framework for managing security and privacy risks in big data architectures, which can be adapted to the specific challenges posed by LLMs.

## Security and Privacy Considerations for LLM Vulnerabilities

Mapping each LLM vulnerability to relevant aspects of ISO/IEC 20547-4:2020:

## LLM01: Prompt Injection

- **Data Processing Security**: Implement secure processing controls to validate and sanitize inputs, preventing prompt injection vulnerabilities.

## LLM02: Insecure Output Handling

- **Data Management and Privacy**: Apply principles of data minimization and secure data handling to manage outputs securely, ensuring they are properly encoded and sanitized.

## LLM03: Training Data Poisoning

- **Data Source Security**: Ensure the integrity and security of data sources for training LLMs, including mechanisms for validating and vetting training data.

## LLM04: Model Denial of Service

- **System and Infrastructure Security**: Design robust infrastructure capable of handling high loads and resisting denial of service attacks through rate limiting and resource allocation.

## LLM05: Supply-Chain Vulnerabilities

- **Data Storage and Infrastructure Security**: Assess and secure the supply chain for software and data components, including third-party services and libraries used by LLMs.

## LLM06: Sensitive Information Disclosure

- **Privacy Protection**: Implement strong data protection measures, including encryption and access controls, to prevent unauthorized disclosure of sensitive information.

## LLM07: Insecure Plugin Design

- **System and Application Security**: Ensure plugins or extensions for LLMs are developed with security in mind, including regular security assessments and updates.

## LLM08: Excessive Agency

- **Data Processing and Management**: Clearly define and enforce boundaries for LLM decision-making capabilities, ensuring they align with security and privacy requirements.

## LLM09: Overreliance

- **Human Factor and Training**: Address the risks associated with overreliance on LLM technologies through user education and awareness programs.

## LLM10: Model Theft

- **Intellectual Property Protection**: Secure LLM models as valuable intellectual property, applying appropriate security measures to prevent unauthorized access and theft.

Note: Implementing the guidelines of ISO/IEC 20547-4:2020 for LLM technologies requires a comprehensive approach, taking into account the unique characteristics and risks associated with large-scale data processing systems. Organizations should conduct regular security and privacy assessments to identify and mitigate potential vulnerabilities in their LLM implementations.
