# Contributing to OWASP Top 10 for LLM Mapping

We welcome contributions from everyone interested in improving and expanding the mappings of the OWASP Top 10 vulnerabilities for Large Language Models (LLMs) to various cybersecurity frameworks and standards. Here's how you can contribute.

## Types of Contributions

### Reporting Bugs or Issues

If you encounter a problem with any mapping, dataset, or scripts, or if you have suggestions for improving them, please open an issue on this GitHub repository with a clear title and a detailed description. Tag the issue with either `bug`, `enhancement`, or `question` to help maintainers triage it appropriately.

### Suggesting Enhancements

This project is open to suggestions for enhancements. This can include new mappings, changes to existing mappings, or improvements in the documentation. Open an issue to suggest enhancements, providing as much context and detail as possible.

### Pull Requests

Here is a quick guide on how to submit a pull request (PR):

1. Fork the repository to your own GitHub account.
2. Clone the forked repository to your machine.
3. Create a new branch for your changes.
4. Make your changes on your branch.
5. Push your branch to your GitHub repository.
6. Submit a pull request to the main repository from your fork and branch.
7. Wait for a maintainer to review your PR, and be open to any further discussions or requests for changes.

**Note**: Before submitting a pull request, please ensure that your changes do not break any existing functionality and that all code conforms to the project's coding standards.

### Data Contributions

If you have access to relevant literature, data, or cybersecurity framework information that is not currently included in the mapping, we encourage you to contribute. Please ensure that the data is reliable and appropriately sourced.

### Documentation

Improvements to documentation, whether it's a typo fix or an entirely new section, are greatly appreciated. Your documentation changes are more likely to be accepted quickly if they are clear, concise, and targeted.

## Discussion and Collaboration

The main channel for discussion and collaboration is on our Slack channel: `#team-llm-datagathering-methodology`

We use this channel for regular discussions on the project's methodology, future enhancements, and any issues we're currently facing. It's a great place to ask questions, propose ideas, and collaborate with others who are working on similar problems.

## Code of Conduct

We have a [Code of Conduct](CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md) that all contributors are expected to adhere to. This outlines our expectations for participant behavior as well as the consequences for unacceptable behavior.

## Questions?

If you have any questions, please feel free to ask on the GitHub issues or directly on the Slack channel (`#team-llm-datagathering-methodology`).

Thank you for contributing to the OWASP Top 10 for LLM Mapping!
