# Instructions for Using the Vulnerability Template

1. **Copy the Template:**  
   Start by making a copy of the `_template.md` file located in this directory.

2. **Populate the Template:**  
   Fill in the template with information about an important vulnerability that you have identified. Be as detailed and thorough as possible to ensure a clear understanding of the vulnerability.

3. **Save Your Work:**  
   Once you have populated the template, save your file with a name that follows the pattern: `YourName_VulnName.md`. This naming convention helps ensure uniqueness and reduce collisions.

4. **Upload Your File:**  
   Upload your completed vulnerability file back to this directory.

Feel free to create as many entries as you like for different proposed vulnerability types. Please keep each vulnerability type to its own file to facilitate later processing. Thank you for your contribution!
