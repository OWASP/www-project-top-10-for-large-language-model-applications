## Title
2025 Top 10 Risk & Mitigations for LLMs and Gen AI Apps

## Short Description
Expore the latest Top 10 risks, vulnerabilities and mitigations for developing and securing generative AI and large language model applications across the development, deployment and management lifecycle.

## Long Description
The OWASP Top 10 for Large Language Model Applications started in 2023 as a community-driven effort to highlight and address security issues specific to AI applications. Since then, the technology has continued to spread across industries and applications, and so have the associated risks. As LLMs are embedded more deeply in everything from customer interactions to internal operations, developers and security professionals are discovering new vulnerabilities—and ways to counter them.
