## Title
2025 Top 10 Risk & Mitigations for LLMs and Gen AI Apps

## Short Description
Expore the latest Top 10 risks, vulnerabilities and mitigations for developing and securing generative AI and large language model applications across the development, deployment and management lifecycle.

## Long Description
大規模言語モデル（LLM）アプリケーションに関するOWASP Top 10は、AIアプリケーション特有のセキュリティ問題を浮き彫りにし、対処するためのコミュニティ主導の取り組みとして2023年に開始されました。それ以来、この技術はさまざまな業界やアプリケーションに広がり続け、それに伴うリスクも増大しています。LLMが顧客とのやり取りから社内業務に至るまで、あらゆるものに深く組み込まれるにつれて、開発者やセキュリティ専門家は新たな脆弱性を発見し、その対策案に貢献しています。
