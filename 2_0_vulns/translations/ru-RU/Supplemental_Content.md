## Long Description
The OWASP Top 10 for Large Language Model Applications started in 2023 as a community-driven effort to highlight and address security issues specific to AI applications. Since then, the technology has continued to spread across industries and applications, and so have the associated risks. As LLMs are embedded more deeply in everything from customer interactions to internal operations, developers and security professionals are discovering new vulnerabilities‚Äîand ways to counter them.

üöÄ Exciting News! New Translations Available for the OWASP Top 10 for LLM & Generative AI (2025) üåç

We‚Äôre thrilled to announce that the OWASP Top 10 for LLM Applications and Generative AI 2025 is now available in Spanish, Persian, Simplified Chinese, Traditional Chinese, Portuguese, and Russian!

This update provides a refreshed and comprehensive resource addressing the top risks, vulnerabilities, and mitigations for securing Generative AI and LLM applications across their development, deployment, and management lifecycle. Whether you're working with RAG-based applications, agentic architectures, or complex LLM integrations, this list is a must-have for developers, security professionals, and organizations looking to adopt AI securely.

What's New in the 2025 OWASP Top 10 for LLMs?

‚úÖ Unbounded Consumption: Expanding beyond denial of service to include risks of resource management and unexpected costs in large-scale deployments.
‚úÖ Vectors & Embeddings Security: Addressing security risks in Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) and other embedding-based techniques.
‚úÖ System Prompt Leakage: A newly added entry tackling real-world exploits and the {risks of assuming prompts remain isolated.
‚úÖ Excessive Agency: As AI autonomy grows, this update highlights security concerns around agentic architectures with limited human oversight.
