# Change Log

All notable changes to the OWASP Top 10 for LLM Applications project will be documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.0.0/), and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## [1.0.1] - 2023-08-26

[v1.1 Instructions for the Expert Group reference](https://github.com/OWASP/www-project-top-10-for-large-language-model-applications/wiki/v1_1-phases#v11-instructions-for-the-expert-group)

### Fixed

- Spelling, grammer, formatting clean ups via an agreed [IDE code linter](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=streetsidesoftware.code-spell-checker) for Vulnerability Entry Leads to prevent future errors and standard conformity throughout the repo.
- Enhancements, updates and recommendations to each vulnerability entry via community-raised [GitHub issues](https://github.com/OWASP/www-project-top-10-for-large-language-model-applications/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+) within the repo which were then triaged to the corresponding [vulnerability entry lead](https://github.com/OWASP/www-project-top-10-for-large-language-model-applications/wiki/Core-Team#core-team-members-as-of-august-27th-2023) for triage and resolution through Pull Requests to the repo `v1.1` [directory](https://github.com/OWASP/www-project-top-10-for-large-language-model-applications/tree/main/1_1_vulns).

### Added

- Architected a `CODEOWNERS` [file](https://github.com/OWASP/www-project-top-10-for-large-language-model-applications/blob/main/CODEOWNERS) and branch protection rules in aid to audit and control CI/CD workflow and updates of the repo against the default branch.
- Redesign of the repo [style and layout](https://github.com/GangGreenTemperTatum/www-project-top-10-for-large-language-model-applications/tree/main/documentation/style) guidelines for vulnerability entries
- Inclusion of [artifacts](https://github.com/GangGreenTemperTatum/www-project-top-10-for-large-language-model-applications/tree/main/1_1_vulns/artifacts) (visual diagrams) which maps the Top 10 entries against a typical LLM application and client/server interaction
- Translations in Chinese, Hindi and Portugese (01-03-2024)
