### Description:

Insecure Design is the result of the insufficient knowledge about AI products, while developing or utilizing applications such as hiring process, trending data,
Government policies, Reviews based of public data, etc
While the products are designed/developed using AI tools such as ChatGPT, bard, or bing, it is imperative to understand the below elements such as
1. how the model is designed such as reviewing its safety standards

https://openai.com/safety
2. what is the privacy policy
https://openai.com/policies/privacy-policy
https://platform.openai.com/docs/models/how-we-use-your-data
https://openai.com/policies
3. Pros and Cons of using different Language models such as biases, reasoning with uncertainty, reward model

### Common Examples of Risk:

1. Example 1: Developing recruiting sites applications without the sufficient knowledge about the biases in the AI model.
2. Example 2: Developing trending data due to data poisoning or to sway public opinion.
3. Example 3: Lack of training to Architects/Developers about AI models.
4. Example 4: Companies build applications exposing client data

### Prevention and Mitigation Strategies:

1. Prevention Step 1: Training the team on AI models
2. Prevention Step 2: Understanding the consequences of implementing products using AI.
3. Prevention Step 3: Secure Design by implementing all the access controls and review the risks.

### Example Attack Scenarios:

Scenario #1: A malicious user can take advantage of how the data is fed into the system and manipulate the outcome.
Scenario #2: A interviewing candidate may lookup for the income and other benefits and may be directed to misleading information.
Scenario #3: Companies may be liable to penalty fee for misusing/exposing the client data, if they didn't review the privacy policy, data retention policy listed by AI products.
