## Overreliance

**Author(s):** Krishna Sankar

### Description

Action : This is an update to the v1.1. The current description and other sections need update as shown below

#### Current
Overreliance on LLMs can lead to misinformation or inappropriate content due to "hallucinations." Without
proper oversight, this can result in legal issues and reputational damage.

#### Discussion
Overreliance doesn't cause hallucination or vice versa. Hallucination/emergent behavior should have it's own place in Top n, not in this.

#### Change as :
Overreliance on LLMs can lead to operational problems, legal issues and reputational damage. Another important risk is the transition to AI mediated enterprise knowledge access

### Common Examples of Risk

1. Partial overlap and underlap between systems that address the same domain can use business impedance mismatch
2. From a customer perspective, data non uniformity is a risk i.e., depending on which way they come in, they will get different answers. Even the answers would be different depending on the question they ask
3. System opacity can result in confusion for customers as well as internal folks
4. Commoditization and distributed rationality can result in materials without context and production lineage. As a result new updated documents might not find their way everywhere they are used 
5. Reduced worker value and loss of agency can result in worker dissatisfaction

### Prevention and Mitigation Strategies

1. Prevention Step 1: Landscape analysis of any and all LLM based applications
2. Prevention Step 2: Cross-Verify information when they are critical that they exist 

### Example Attack Scenarios

1. Multiple overlapping lLMs on the same process creating confusion and cross purposes
